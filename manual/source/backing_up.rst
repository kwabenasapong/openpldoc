You can select an individual folder or all of the folders and copy your data to 
your choice of media or a flash drive. This is also an easy way to get all of 
your data onto another computer that is running OpenLP. 

You can restore your data folders and files by copying them back into your data 
folder :menuselection:`Tools --> Open Data Folder...`. You will overwrite all of 
your original data with the data you are copying back into the folder. 

**Warning:** Once you overwrite your data there is no way to retrieve your 
original data.

shut down OpenLP and restart it to see the changes.
