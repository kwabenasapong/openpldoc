The Web Remote
==============

OpenLP gives you the ability to control the :ref:`creating_service` or send an 
:ref:`alerts` from a remote computer through a web browser. This could be useful 
for a nursery or daycare to display an :ref:`alerts` message or, use it as an 
interface to control the whole service remotely by a visiting missionary or 
worship team leader. 

The first step is to make sure the Remote plugin is activated. You can accomplish
this here: :ref:`plugin_list`. The second step is to configure the settings you 
will use with your web browser. You can find these instructions and settings 
here: :ref:`remote_tab`.

Open your favorite web browser and type in the Remote URL you found in 
:ref:`remote_tab`. For this example we will use \http://192.168.0.101:4316 and 
then press the :kbd:`Enter` key. You will be presented with the home page of 
OpenLP Remote.

Stage view gives you the opportunity to set up a remote computer, netbook or 
smartphone to view the service being displayed in an easy to read font on a  
black background. This is a text only viewer.
