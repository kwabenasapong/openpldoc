Media Manager
=============

Once you get your system set up for OpenLP you will be ready to add content to
your Service Manager. This will all happen through the **Media Manager**. The
Media Manager contains all the Bibles, Songs, Presentations, Media, and 
everything else that you will project through OpenLP.

Enabling the Plugins
--------------------

You may need to enable the default plugins that are built in to OpenLP. As you 
can see below this is what the *Media Manager* looks like with all the plugins 
enabled.

press :kbd:`Alt+F7`. You will want to click on the plugin to the left that you
would like to enable and select *Active* from the drop down box to the right.
