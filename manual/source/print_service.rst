Print Service 
=============

OpenLP gives you the option to print your service order. This can be useful for
a variety of reasons, such as giving to your music team so they know the song
order, or so pastors or speakers can know what is happening, etc.

To print your service go to :menuselection:`File --> Print Service` or press 
:kbd:`Control + P`
