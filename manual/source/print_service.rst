=============
Print Service 
=============

OpenLP gives you the option to print your service order. This can be useful for
a variety of reasons, such as giving the printed service to your music team so
they have the song order, or so pastors or speakers can have the flow of the
service.

To print your service go to :menuselection:`File --> Print Service` or press 
:kbd:`Control + P`.

Customizing with CSS
--------------------

It is possible to customize the printed service using CSS. To do this go to
:menuselection:`Tools --> Open Data Folder` If you have a file named 
servicePrint.css delete it. In the open folder create a file named 
service_print.css containing your customizations.
